[The project is now discontinued (and the edition incomplete). I then continued my work on these methodological principles with the Ursus Project http://www1.unipa.it/paolo.monella/ursus/index.html and the Romualdus Project http://www1.unipa.it/paolo.monella/romualdus/index.html]

Scholarly digital edition of the Iudicium coci et pistoris by Vespa. More information in http://www.unipa.it/paolo.monella/lincei/edition.html (the home page of the work in progress) and http://www.unipa.it/paolo.monella/lincei/files/aiucd/vespa_aiucd_paper.pdf (an article in English).

File 'issues.txt' articulates the open issues.
The function of the rest of the files is explained in
